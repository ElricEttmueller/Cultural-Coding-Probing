# Contributing to the Coder's Cultural Probe

Welcome to our unique research project! This isn't just a regular coding contribution - it's an exploration of how developers work, think, and create. Through this process, you'll not only write code but also reflect on your development experience.

## How to Participate

### 1. Fork & Clone
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a new branch with your name: `git checkout -b probe/your-name`

### 2. Your Journey

Your contribution will consist of three parts:

#### A. Coding Tasks
Choose one (or more) of these tasks:
1. **Bug Fix Journey**: Fix the bugs in `examples/bug_fix_scenario.py`
2. **Feature Development**: Add a new feature to `examples/feature_development.py`
3. **Code Refactoring**: Improve the code in `examples/code_review_refactor.py`

As you code, you'll find `@probe` comments asking about your process. These are part of the research - engage with them!

#### B. Creative Reflection
In the `reflections` directory, create a new file named `your-name-reflection.md` and answer these questions:

1. **Your Coding Space**
   - Describe your ideal coding environment
   - What makes it special?
   - Share a sketch or photo if you'd like!

2. **Tools as Extensions**
   - If your IDE was a physical tool, what would it be?
   - What would your debugger look like in the real world?
   - Draw or describe these metaphors!

3. **Time and Flow**
   - When do you feel most 'in the zone' while coding?
   - What breaks your flow?
   - Create a timeline of your perfect coding day

4. **Code as Art**
   - If your code was a piece of art, what would it be?
   - What colors represent different aspects of your code?
   - Feel free to express this visually!

#### C. Developer Diary
Create a `diary/your-name-diary.md` file and use it to:
- Document your thought process
- Note interesting moments during development
- Share any "aha!" moments
- Reflect on challenges and solutions

### 3. Submit Your Story
1. Commit your changes with meaningful messages
2. Push to your fork
3. Create a Pull Request with:
   - Title: "Cultural Probe: [Your Name]"
   - Description: Brief overview of your experience

## Guidelines

- **Be Creative**: There are no wrong answers - we want your unique perspective!
- **Be Honest**: Share real experiences and thoughts
- **Be Detailed**: The more you share, the more we learn
- **Have Fun**: This is an exploration, not an exam

## Privacy

- You control what you share
- All data will be anonymized
- You can use a pseudonym if preferred
- Specify if you don't want certain parts shared publicly

## Questions?

Open an issue labeled "Question" if you need clarification or have ideas to share!
