# Getting Started with the Coder's Cultural Probe

Welcome! This guide will walk you through participating in our research project step by step.

## Quick Start Guide üöÄ

### 1. Setup (5 minutes)
```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cultural-probes.git
cd cultural-probes

# Create your branch
git checkout -b probe/your-name

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Choose Your Path (2 minutes)
Pick one (or more) of these coding scenarios:
- üêõ **Bug Fix**: `examples/bug_fix_scenario.py`
- ‚ú® **Feature Development**: `examples/feature_development.py`
- üîÑ **Code Refactoring**: `examples/code_review_refactor.py`

### 3. Start Your Journey (30-60 minutes)

#### A. Coding Task
1. Open your chosen scenario
2. Read through the code and `@probe` comments
3. Work on the task naturally
4. Respond to probe questions in your diary

Example probe interaction:
```python
# @probe:workflow How do you typically approach debugging tasks like this?
def calculate_total(items):
    # Your code and thoughts here
```

#### B. Creative Reflection (20-30 minutes)
1. Copy `reflections/TEMPLATE_reflection.md` to `reflections/your-name-reflection.md`
2. Fill in each section with your thoughts
3. Feel free to add sketches, diagrams, or other media!

Example reflection:
```markdown
### If your IDE was a physical tool...
My IDE would be a Swiss Army knife - compact but full of useful tools.
Each extension is like a different blade, ready for specific tasks...
```

#### C. Developer Diary (10-15 minutes)
1. Copy `diary/TEMPLATE_diary.md` to `diary/your-name-diary.md`
2. Document your experience as you work
3. Update it with discoveries and challenges

Example diary entry:
```markdown
### Today's Focus
Working on the bug fix scenario. Started by reading through the code...

### Insights
- Discovered an interesting pattern in how I approach debugging
- The @probe questions made me think differently about my tools
```

## Tips for a Great Experience üí°

### 1. Be Natural
- Work as you normally would
- Let the probes guide reflection without disrupting flow
- There are no "right" answers

### 2. Be Creative
- Use metaphors and analogies
- Draw sketches if they help explain your thoughts
- Share your unique perspective

### 3. Be Detailed
- Capture your thoughts in the moment
- Note both successes and challenges
- Include environmental factors

### 4. Be Honest
- Share real experiences
- Document frustrations and victories
- Your authentic insights are valuable
