## Choosing Your Level 🎯

1. **Start with Your Comfort Zone**
   - Begin with examples that match your experience
   - Move up when you feel confident
   - There's no rush - take your time!

2. **Learning Path**
   - Each level builds on the previous one
   - Focus on understanding before moving up
   - Use the @probe comments for reflection

3. **Reflection Points**
   Each example includes @probe comments that ask:
   - How would you improve the code?
   - What patterns do you recognize?
   - What would you do differently?

## Getting Help 💁‍♀️
