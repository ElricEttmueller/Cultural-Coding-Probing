# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is a Cultural Probe?
A cultural probe is a research tool designed to understand how people work and interact with their environment. In this case, we're using it to explore how developers code, what tools they use, and how they think about their development process.

### How long will this take?
The basic participation takes about 1-2 hours:
- Coding task: 30-60 minutes
- Creative reflection: 20-30 minutes
- Developer diary: 10-15 minutes

### Do I need to be an expert developer?
No! We welcome developers of all skill levels. Your unique perspective is valuable regardless of your experience level.

## Participation Questions

### Can I participate anonymously?
Yes! You can use a pseudonym for your contributions. Just make sure to mention this in your pull request.

### What if I can't complete all parts?
That's okay! While we encourage completing all sections, partial contributions are also valuable. Do what you can and note why you couldn't complete certain parts.

### Can I add my own probes or questions?
Absolutely! Feel free to add your own reflection questions or probe points. Just document them in your diary.

### Should I record my screen/environment?
This is optional. If you're comfortable sharing screenshots or photos of your setup, they can be valuable additions to your reflection.

## Technical Questions

### What programming languages do I need to know?
The example scenarios are in Python, but you can modify them to use your preferred language. Just document the changes in your diary.

### Do I need to install any special tools?
Just Python and Git. Any additional tools you use should be documented in your diary as part of the research.

### What if I find bugs in the probe code?
Please report them by opening an issue! Finding and fixing bugs can be an interesting part of your probe experience.

## Content Questions

### How detailed should my responses be?
Be as detailed as feels natural. Quality over quantity - we're interested in authentic insights rather than long responses.

### Can I include drawings/diagrams?
Yes, please do! Visual representations can be very helpful. You can include:
- Sketches of your workspace
- Diagrams of your workflow
- Mind maps of your thinking process
- Screenshots of your setup

### What if I disagree with the probe questions?
That's interesting data too! Document your disagreement and explain your perspective.

## Privacy Questions

### How will my data be used?
Your contributions will be used for research purposes only. We'll analyze patterns and insights across all participants to understand developer workflows better.

### Can I remove my data later?
Yes. If you want your data removed, open an issue or contact us directly. We'll remove your contributions from the repository.

### What parts of my contribution will be public?
Only what you submit in your pull request will be public. You control what you share.
