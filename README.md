# Codebase Cultural Probe

A creative exploration of developers' working environments, habits, and practices through a combination of coding tasks, reflective writing, and artistic expression.

## Overview

This cultural probe combines three unique approaches to understand how developers work:
1. **Code Interactions**: Embedded probes in real coding tasks
2. **Creative Reflection**: Metaphorical and artistic exploration of development
3. **Developer Diary**: Daily documentation of the coding journey

## How to Participate

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Complete coding tasks with embedded probes
3. Create your reflection piece
4. Document your journey in the developer diary
5. Submit your story via pull request
