# Research Goals and Methodology

## Overview 🎯

This Cultural Probe project aims to understand the rich, complex world of software development through the eyes of developers themselves. Rather than using traditional surveys or interviews, we're taking an innovative approach that integrates naturally with developers' workflows.

## Research Questions 🤔

We're exploring several key areas:

### 1. Development Environment
- How do developers organize their physical and digital workspaces?
- What role does the environment play in productivity and creativity?
- How do different tools and setups influence coding practices?

### 2. Workflow Patterns
- What are the natural rhythms of development work?
- How do developers approach different types of tasks?
- What triggers flow states or disrupts them?

### 3. Tool Usage
- How do developers interact with their tools?
- What metaphors do they use to think about their tools?
- How do tools shape thinking and problem-solving?

### 4. Creative Process
- How do developers visualize code and systems?
- What role does creativity play in development?
- How do aesthetic considerations influence code organization?

## Methodology 📝

Our approach combines three complementary methods:

### 1. Embedded Probes
- Natural integration with coding tasks
- Real-time reflection during work
- Capture of in-the-moment insights

### 2. Creative Reflection
- Metaphorical exploration of tools and processes
- Visual representation of abstract concepts
- Personal narrative of development experience

### 3. Developer Diary
- Documentation of daily experiences
- Capture of challenges and solutions
- Record of environmental factors
